## Feedback - Joakim Sj√∂gren

function.php:20-35 - I would've renamed "$Item" to something that better explains what it is.

function.php - Remember to use strict types. Such as "string" or "int". To make sure you get the right result. 

function.php - I would recommend to use more comments, to explain what you are doing and why.

function.php:20-35 - Instead of having to close and reopen php tags. maybe you could use the "<br>" within you php code.

function.php40-42 - I would've used another name for the "sortFunction" and instead name it to what you are sorting.
I would also rename the parameters: "$a", "$b".

Overall a really great job!
